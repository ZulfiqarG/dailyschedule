# Daily_Planner
## A simple planner for a work day

### Live Page: https://dailyplannerzs.netlify.app/


The planner is built of 9 rows (for each hour from 9AM - 5PM), each containing the hour, a block of text for notes/apppointments and a save button.
Focus has been given to jquery in the composition of this page.

This project was a good chance to explore moment.js, one of the criteria being that the styling of the rows should alter depending on that row's relation to the current hour.
